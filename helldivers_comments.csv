1m6fwf5,n4jbfdn,Ok-Two-3743,t3_1m6fwf5,"Didn't buff stun/arc enough to compensate status effect glitch. Stun went from fairly niche to outright useless for many weapons. Time needed to apply stun needs to be buffed asap. Need to also guve back many arc strategems ability to stun again. 


Epoch is a poor weapon with no identity. Not good as AT, not good as a Heavy/Medium killer, not good at ground control/chaff killing. It needs buff in one of these aspects. My suggestion: Buff AoE and slight damage increase guving it a chaff kill role. This way it makes it unique frim other energy weapons (Quassar for AT, Laser Gun for Medium/Heavy enemies, Railgun for All Rounder)

**why does the laser sentry need improvement?**

Destroying itself by overheating was not necessary, as all sentries have a max up-time anyway. I’d just have it cool down (like all other laser equipment) when overheated and resume firing after reaching 0% again (it’s dead either way if it stops shooting).

**Why does the epoch need improvement?**

Horrendous spread value, and maybe swap mag capacity and max mag amount (same amount of shots, but you get an even number of 4 before needing to reload).

If you warp every 5s, as soon as the cooldown goes down, you're basically adding 2m/s to your running speed, which is 5m/s on medium armor, and 4.5m/s and 5.5m/s for heavy and light armor respectively.

so on medium armor it basically means you get a 40% speed boost when you warp on cooldown.

1m7cavd,n4qji4a,SES-SpearofDemocracy,t3_1m7cavd,"They are great at what they do. They will kill the most Heavies throughout an entire mission if used right compared to any other Eagle. Before I begin, let me provide some information about myself to maybe, hopefully, add a little credibility to my following statements. I have over 1000 in mission hours with 4.5 million xp (that means I spend most of my 1000 hours on D10). I have made 44 different builds that are all thematic, and tested / proven on D10. I've tested, and tried to break every Strategem in the game to find every little quirk it has to offer. Now, my opinions on Eagle 110's



Tip#1: Eagle 110's target the largest enemy, closest to the ball, \*when\* it lands. As soon as the ball lands, Eagle-1 acquires her target and will now track that target until impact. Eagle 110's do NOT target the enemy near the beam when the rockets land. Throwing the 110's ahead of a target and luring them into the beam WILL miss as a target was NOT acquired when the ball was originally thrown (target too far, no target in sight). Throwing the ball as close to your intended target will remove 95% of the misses.



Tip#2: Eagle 110's will reliably oneshot: Hulks, Tanks, Turrets, and Impalers. They (can) oneshot Chargers and Harvesters, but it has to be a shot to the side (or butt). This happens when assisting another diver who is being targeted by those enemies.



Tip#3: Eagle 110's are a HUGE compliment to AP4 weapons. They allow your (AC, AMR, HMG, Flamer, De-Escalator, Laser Cannon) to Flex AT, on demand, with minimal Time and Ammo invested. A single 110 against a Bile Titan will weaken it to the point that any of these weapons can finish it in a second or so with 1/3 the ammo needed. A normal BT kill would take several seconds and almost an entire clip (or two). This allows you to be the AP4 for your team, clearing medium and chaff, and go into AT mode when needed. Enemies that are severely weakened are: Charger (if not hit in the side or butt), Harvester (if not hit in the side), Bile Titan, Fleshmobs.



Tip#4: Eagle 110's have 4 uses with a 2 minute cooldown. 4 uses (if used as directed above) will be 4 dead heavies and can be repeated 2 minutes after the last shot. If used regularly, you will be racking up heavy kills.",29,1753287468.0

Pre-Argument rebuttals: Since this is not my first time defending Eagle 110's I will pose some of the common arguments against what I've said as well as my responses to them.

\#1- ""Why bring something that ""weakens"" targets when you can outright kill them""

\-Because you get 4 of them. Eagle 110 will kill the enemies listed above in 1 shot, and weaken a few of the heavier enemies. With 4 charges, one shotting everything would be far too OP (4 Orbital Rail Cannons with a 2 min CD?). This is their role. Target softening for AP4 weapons, making them save ammo and time, but still able to contend with heavy enemies.

\#2- ""Why bring that when I can bring 500kg and outright kill them""

\- Again because you get 4 charges. If used as directed above you will be getting 4 kills per Eagle Re-Arm where 500kg will be getting 2 (although I've seen plenty of enemies shrug off 500kgs). Even in the rare case of Multiple Heavies killed, you would need 2 Heavies for \*every, single, throw\* just to keep up with the 110's. And that just doesn't happen. You would need \*more\* than 2 heavies per throw to surpass 110's. 500kg has plenty of other uses and is very versatile, and if that's what you want, fantastic, bring it. But if you are looking solely to kill heavies the 110's are the way to go. Most AP4 weapons can handle most things. AC for example handles Chaff, Mediums, and Hole / Fab closing. What it needs a little help with is killing heavies. In this case, I would prefer the 110's as I can kill more heavies with it, and don't need help with the AOE or base / nest closing.

\#3- ""Strafe is a better 110""

\- Strafe is arguably the best Eagle in the game. There are 3 differences I can point out to favor 110's in the specific role of AT. \*Please note that I love Eagle Strafe and will often bring Strafe and 110's together\*. Difference 1, Eagle strafe \*can\* miss. If a Charger is charging, the strafe can go right by it. The 110 will not (if used as directed). Difference 2, Eagle strafe \*can\* teamkill. This goes for the 500kg as well, and it is less common with the strafe given its narrow attack pattern, however, if a teammate is being trampled by a charger that strafe Will kill him. The 110, however, will not. In the event of standing at a breach killing enemies that come out, the 110 will be the safest AT option, it will not kill the scared cadet running in circles and in everyone's line of fire, and it wont kill the Flamer, holding the front line roasting bugs. And Difference 3, Strafe may indeed crack the armor of a BT, but it does not do nearly as much damage as the 110's. The 110's will soften a BT far more than the strafe will allowing for far less ammo and time to finish it over the strafe. Now, just like the 500kg the strafe is very versatile and if that's what you want out of it, then have at it. But in the category of AT the 110 squeezes out (although I do wish it had 5 like strafe).

In the end, no one is making you take Eagle 110's. If you prefer the versatility of the other eagles then enjoy them on your drops! But the Eagle 110 is nowhere near trash, bad, terrible, or useless. It suffers from a lack of clarity on how to use it, and what its function is. But once you understand and put into practice the information I have provided here, you too will find great success with them.

If anyone has any further questions, or would like clarification on anything feel free to ask. I love 110's and use them frequently, and I hope you will too.",10,1753287475.0

1m7cavd,n4r1eu9,edenhelldiver,t3_1m7cavd,"I want to like them and I’m sure they are usable (they were mostly usable when I last tried them ages ago), but when I last used them, they just had one too many problems to be worthwhile compared to something like the 500kg or Strafing Run. If the lock-on or damage were more reliable then maybe. I run the Railcannon Strike sometimes even though everyone says it’s ass, because it checks a very specific box that some otherwise great builds need checked. In principle, 110mm pods could be the same.

Part of the issue is that the other Eagles mentioned are arguably too good. You can use an AP4 weapon to help the Strafing Run finish off a Charger or Tank or Cannon Turret just as easily as it could help the 110mm pods, but the pods usually don’t help against crowds or swarms, while the Strafing Run does. The 500kg doesn’t usually ask for any help in killing heavies (sans Factory Striders and Harvesters, but the 110mm pods presumably aren’t getting that done), and the 500kg can take out Bile Titan holes and hostile secondary objectives like the Detector Tower. (I think 110mm pods can do this too, at least the Bile Titan holes, but you’re praying it DOESN’T try to lock onto a heavy instead.)

Apply the same logic of the EAT vs Commando. 2 Commando shots do the same damage as one EAT, so functionally you can carry 2 EATs on your back. You can still do the same amount of damage, just with an extra half second of work. Opening up tons of forgiveness in how you use the weapon.

I see people panic throwing 500s at Hulks and Chargers, and usually whiffing or smoking their team. The 110 will Automatically locate and one shot these guys so you can just drop the beacon at your feet and run... And then do it 3 more times. (only failing to one shot Hulks if it hits them perpendicularly and knocks off one of their arms). Want to kill a fabricator? You can reliably kill FOUR with a >2 min cooldown. See a teammate who only drops with a RR, who has a charger right up his ass? Throw a 110 directly at him, and it will peel the big bug bastard off like a tick. Want to kill a turret tower but your 500 beacon keeps rolling slightly out of range or you can't get it on top of the cliff just-so? Throw the 110 beacon in its fucking neighbourhood and that turret is gone (unless there is a heavy near by which will die to a happy little accident) and then you can just throw another one 5 seconds later without giving it a chance to fucking one shot you while you line up a rocket or quasar. Got artillery troops hitting you from over a cliff or wall and you can't tell exactly where it's coming from? Toss a 110 in their general compass direction and it will find them. Got danger close with heavies but all them pesky small guys keep eating your RR that you crutch on? Literally throw the 110 at yourself and it will remove the heavy from the equation. Even against bile titans and fabrication walkers, you can literally hammer them with 110s every 5 seconds while you either run the hell away, or hit them with your support weapon. 

The 110 allows you to use builds with primaries with low penetration, jet packs, shield packs, MGs, grenade launchers flame throwers or whatever else you like for utility or dominating groups of small/medium troops and crowd control without being hard countered by one shottable heavies. Not to mention if you have the perk that makes your Eagle reload faster when you manually rear with charges left, if you toss 2 during a fight for an enemy base, then hit rearm as you leave and head to the next one, you will have your strategem at full power before you even see another enemy. 

For reference I'm level 145 and pretty much only play on Diff 10, a 0 death game with 300-400 kills is my average.

The ONLY weakness the 110 has is its inability to cheese kill detector towers. But when you've had 4 missle strikes clearing out any major threats, they become trivial anyway.

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk. I hope OP stubs his toe every day this week for spreading this undemocratic propaganda.

They already destroy everything that isn’t a superheavy in one run. You can 3 uses, 4 with an upgrade. It is AP 7, meaning it beats every armour in the game (it’s the same AP as the thermite and orbital railcannon). It fires 3 salvos of 2 rockets per run, 600 damage per rocket, isn’t reduced by durability. It deals its full damage versus everything. That’s 3600 damage assuming all rockets hit, just under half an ORC shot. It also cracks open armour, allowing softer AT like the Autocannon to damage super heavies like the Bile Titan. 

The 110s has a cooldown of 15s (which can be drastically reduced with upgrades) so you can easily chuck a second run almost immediately after the first, while the ORC has a cooldown of 210 seconds. In fact, with no upgrades, you could chuck your 3 110s, wait for Eagle-1 to rearm and chuck a fourth one and you’d only be 30 seconds slowed than tossing 2 ORCs.

With upgrades, the 110s beats the ORC in DPS.

Edit: I had forgotten about Strafing run, which pretty much does the same thing as the 110s but with a wider area and without the enemy seeking. It’s more a case of Strafing run being overtuned than the 110s being weak.

I will now debate every tip here then answer your pre argument too . 

First and second tip you gave is actually describing one of the biggest weaknesses of 110 . Its inefficient . You have to most thing perfectly while in battle (throwing ball close and accurate etc) and it doesn't even one shot Titans and war striders

Inconsistent at best. I've seen plenty of scout striders get targeted while theres hulks/tanks around where the orb landed.

>Tip#2: Eagle 110's will reliably oneshot: Hulks, Tanks, Turrets

This is not true. Hulks often end up damage but not destroyed because the arms absorb a rocket. You have to have all 3 rockets hit the vent. The same goes for the tanks and turrets. The Annihiliator tank has 2100 turret hp and 750 vent hp. Just like the hulks, all 3 rockets have to direct hit the vent. 

It does not consistently target heavies or 1 shot them. I've never brought them on bugs but I'd imagine it can't 1 shot the impaler either without a direct headshot, and at that point, bring the strafing run.",1,1753296660.0

Saying it will kill four heavies is not true. It will help you kill 4 heavies. how many can it actually kill on its own? I don't it's better value that way compared to 500kg.

""But you have to consider the whole load out and context"" yeah and same is true for 500kg, which can be used for closing holes, wiping patrols, destroying more buidlings. 

Additionally, having 4 uses isn't as direct an upgrade as it seems. Often times you'll end up with one or two left over, which then in the time between combat the 500kg would've recharged, but now you have 2 or 1 110s to 2 500kgs.

[Here is a clip of how you can kill 4 heavies back to back with the 110mm Rocket Pods.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/s/VXIMugOAgd) A 500kg can’t compare with the 110mm supplemented by an AP4 weapon in the heavy killing department. It also has the added bonus of being more reliable on hitting obscured targets, doesn’t punish poor placement, and is a lot safer to use than the 500kg.

People keep assessing this stratagem in isolation, but unlike the vast majority of the stratagems in the game, this one requires synergy in order to work to its full potential. This “cost” of requiring a synergy does however push the 110mm beyond most other AT offensive stratagems when you do play into this synergy.

You may think it a weakness, but to improve it would put it out of balance. As I stated in my first rebuttal, having it 1 shot everything would be insanely over powered. You would get 4 Orbital Rail Cannons on a 2 min CD. It would trivialize everything (and honestly, when I use it, it already does). Now I don't disagree with or condemn anyone wanting to bring the versatile strategems, that's perfectly fine. I've found, through all of my theorycrafting and build making, that a lot of the AP4 weapons are very versatile in and of themselves. The one thing they do tend to lack the most is the efficiency to kill heavies. While they can kill heavies without help, it is usually very ammo and time intensive. Me personally, I get more value out of assistance with 4 heavies every 2 min instead of 2 big booms for groups, or nests, or a heavy or two. As for the inefficiency claim. Throwing the beacon close to your target is fairly easy to do, even in the heat of combat. You don't need to stick your target everytime, the biggest point I was trying to make is you can't lead your target like a 500kg or an OPS. It has to land close to the target to pick up the targeting. \*note to self - do some tests to determine minimum distance to target needed\*.

Eagle 110 does 600 damage or 600 durable damage x 3, 2 times. (so 3600 damage) as AP7.

Hulks body is 1800 HP AP4 with 60% Durable damage (since the damage and durable damage are the same this is irrelevant). Unless Eagle-1 comes in at a weird angle and ONLY hits the arms with all 6 rockets will a Hulk survive.

Its not necessarily that you need to take AP4 weapons to make them work, its that you bring them when you decide to run AP4 to make killing heavies easier. If you decide to run an AC for example, you will save significant ammo and time using a 110. Sure you will save \*more\* ammo and time with a 500kg, but throughout the course of a mission, with the assistance of the 110 your AP4 will kill more heavies than the 500kg. True alone a 500k will kill more (or at least tie) certain enemies like the BT who needs about 2 110's to kill, but again the point is it is a Weapon amplifier. But when it comes to smaller enemies like hulks or tanks or impalers, it is a direct 1-1 kill and thus the 4 eagles out compete the 2. And last, yes its not a direct 4-2 comparison, there are times when you have 1-2 eagles left over and need to re-arm thus wasting them.

The enemies it wont kill are the BT and Fleshmob. Again, as stated that is not its role. That would be far too overpowered (4 Orbital Rail Cannons in 2 min). It is an amplifier for AP4 weapons. Instead of needing 1(or2) whole clips plus 5-7 seconds to kill a BT, the 110 allows a kill in 1-2 seconds with 1/3 of a clip.

So, if you like running AP4 weapons you can now be a backup AT to support your RR diver. Let me expound upon how the ""weakening"" enemy works. In an actual battle, lets say you are standing at a breach killing enemies as they spawn. You see a BT crawl out and you are rocking the AC clearing enemies. You would throw a 110 next to it. As the Eagle is flying in to deliver its payload (about 2 sec) you would start unloading into the BTs face (from my testing I think its 5-6 shots with a 110). While shooting the 110 lands and the BT is dead. All of this takes about 2 sec from Strategem toss to Rockets landing. As it dies you return to pelting the Chaff climbing out of the hole. Its not as if you are just running around weakening enemies and leaving them on the field, and you take no longer to kill the heavies than a 500kg does.

I still believe 500kg is still just better overall. I think the 110s could use the following:

A slight damage increase to make them slightly more consistent and better at softening. I don't know exactly breakpoints so I can't tell you how much off the top of my head, but just a little extra.

And make it come near instantly. This will help it feel more intuitive and useful, while also further differentiating it from 500kg but still not stepping on strafing runs toes too much.

Crazier idea I would not be opposed to instead would be making it target two enemies on each throw, so it has some extra utility killing an alpha commander that's with a charger or softening two BTs or just killing a group of devastators in a pinch.

The tank/turret has 2100 hp with 750 on the vent. Even at the 200% damage buff that explosives get when hitting said vent, it requires 3 direct hits to kill them.

 The hulk, like he said, is also inconsistent, as the arms often take rockets and only transfer a small portion of that damage to the main hp.

1m7cavd,n4rnjdf,BICKELSBOSS,t1_n4rm2zu,"Your 500kg may kill a couple other units, but generally speaking, the 500kg’s main purpose is killing heavies. If you want to kill a lot of smaller enemies you would be better off bringing the cluster bomb.

Using the autocannon, or any other AP4 support weapon to finish heavies off is the entire point of the 110mm’s. If they killed any heavy outright, they would dumb down the heavy scene by a significant margin. The OPS requires clever placement. The 500kg requires clever placement. The Railcannon Strike is a limited panic button, and the Orbital Laser has limited uses. If the 110’s oneshotted heavies reliably, they would suddenly outperform all AT Offensive Stratagems, on top of also being the second most convenient one to use.

The 110’s are fine. They may be underwhelming on their own, but if you enjoy using the AC, HMG, AMR, LC or Railgun, the 110’s are an absolute godsend.",1,1753298444.0

The ammo pool is fixed at 15 rounds, so for comparison, let's assume every shot lands dead-on. Obviously unrealistic, but it keeps the math clean.  
  
Uncharged shots do 100 standard + 75 explosive = 175 total damage.  
Charged shots do 200 standard + 300 explosive = 500 total damage.

Uncharged fires at 1000 RPM, which is faster than the HMG and about on par with the Stalwart.  
 Charged shots fire at 50 RPM, since they take 1.2 seconds each. 60/1.2 = 50

That gives you:

* Full-auto DPS: \~2,917
* Charged DPS: \~417
* Scorcher DPS (for reference): \~1,166

Roughly 7x improvement from charged to full auto, and 3x the Scorcher.

Downside? Ammo efficiency.  
The uncharged magazine does 2,625 total damage, while the charged does 7,500 damage  
  
However, that's why I just do both!  
On my mouse:

* Forward button = full-auto spray (great for emergencies)
* Back button = charged fire (solid for clearing chaff and medium enemies)

Regarding macros, it’s a co-op game, the Squids don’t have feelings.

Sure, you could call it circumventing, but to me it’s less about gaining an edge and more about tinkering with systems for the sheer fun of it. I just like scripting and building macros, it’s fun.   
Half the enjoyment is seeing what I can automate - the other half is watching it actually work (or catastrophically fail) in the middle of chaos.

1m6wt04,n4ok3u1,crankpatate,t1_n4oif2h,"I do know that the purifier has insane RPM for some unknown reason. But besides that your assessment is still not very good. The charged purifier shot gets a large AoE explosion. The explosion part can hit A LOT of enemies at once. In the video scenario he could have killed A TON of voteless with just one single charged shot into them.

Besides that, the explosion DMG has special positive properties over the projectile dmg and the explosion dmg is what scales up a lot more when you charge the shot. Explosion dmg ignores durability completely and depending on enemy type it can hit multiple bodyparts and thus multiply the DMG a single shot can deal.

And then there's the stagger and push back power, that scales up, too. Can save your but, when you can stagger lock multiple stalkers instead of mag dumping one and then getting overwhelmed by the rest.

I would not recommend spamming purifier uncharged shots. Besides the horrible ammo economy you create that way, it really isn't better in a lot of scenarios. I use uncharged to snipe single small units or when I have to emergency mag dump to get rid of something FAST.",3,1753262105.0

1m6wt04,n4ol6ux,FancyMalon,t1_n4ok3u1,"Totally fair points, especially about explosion mechanics, stagger, and AoE scaling. I actually do use both fire modes depending on the situation.

I mentioned it earlier, but for clarity: my mouse is mapped so that one button fires uncharged full auto, and the other handles proper charged shots with auto-recharge. I use uncharged when I need something dead immediately, and charged when I want crowd control or ammo efficiency.

The flying Dorito is a good example of when I absolutely \*would\* recommend using the auto fire- It's a snitch, it flies (no point in AOE), and it'll call reinforcements if it doesn't die immediately.  
  
In the video, I didn’t use charged shots because:

A) I wasn’t sure if shooting from inside the ship would reflect or glitch out and hit *me*  
B) I was kind of curious how people would react to the auto clicker behavior and whether it’d annoy anybody

1m6wt04,n4oj4e7,FancyMalon,t1_n4ofjd3,"It depends on what you're doing, unfortunately.  
My auto fire macro is 10 milliseconds and that pretty consistently works. Occasionally it'll act weirdly, but it's few and far between. It's never a catastrophic failure, just a reduced firerate.

If you're looking to bind stratagems, it gets finnicky.  
To open the stratagem menu only needs 5 milliseconds or so, while actually inputting them needs 25 milliseconds for consistency. It \*can\* do 5, but I found it caused more headache than benefit. In combat, consistency is usually more valuable for a macro than speed.

I've bound resupply to T and reinforce to 5, both being near enough to the reload/melee buttons.

And yes, I use AutoHotkey. The script starts up with my computer and checks every 120 seconds if Helldivers is open. If so, it activates/deactivates itself.

Bots you just get blasted all over the shop, shells and cannons and flames and fire from across the map in an endless stream. Hell even the music is stressful.

Bugs is just a misty foggy mess where literally every single unit can spawn in a bug hole and then you're being torn limb from limb by invisible leaping wankers.


Illuminate are predictable, comfy even to play against. Kill the Watchers, cos you've only got yourself to blame if a drop arrives on Squids, those MFers are easy to see and easy to kill. The Warp Ships are a joke compared to finding 9 bug holes in the dark fog or having to negotiate a barb wired mines to the tits fortress in the dark while being shot from 49 directions, and scrambled, with an AT-AT walker literally being dropped on your head.

Levi's are giant, and slow, and easy to see, easy to kill. Pop a wing and anyone can pour fire into the damaged sector. Stingrays are the best designed unit going, punishing if you ignore them but telegraphed if you take them on. Overseers are just an annoyance, drop three at a time with an LC and done. The Cog towers only change your buttons, not hard block like Bot towers.

Harvesters are totally manageable compared to the death machines that Striders are. Let's not even start on the blizzard of grenades if you even think about taking cover versus a War Strider. Or tentacles up your arse from an Impaler you can't even see cos he's 300ft away and it's all green mist anyway.

They're just not as fun for the majority of the community.   
  
Also, once you've fought them for two or three operations, you've seen it all repeatedly. They get stale quick by comparison to bugs and bots who have lots of different mission types, enemy types, and constellations to change things up.

1m71ot3,n4qszw5,satiregolem,t1_n4psv9s,"Straightforward, yes. Easy or fun, not really. The main thing for me is that every squid unit is super aggressive and dangerous compared to units from other factions, and you NEED to kill, disable, or run from them, or they'll kill you - except any of those 3 options is often not viable.

With a huge pack of bugs you can keep a medium distance, pick off any hunters and dodge the occasional charger - otherwise you can mostly avoid damage just by walking.

With a big pack of bots, the dangerous ranged units are slow, so you can run to cover, fight for a bit, reposition, repeat.

On squids, almost every unit can can be on top of you in about 10 seconds. Voteless, Fleshmobs, Jetpack overseers, are on your case 24/7 until they're killed. And you can't just run because first of all, you need to do objectives, which often require you to stay in one place, and second of all, a lot of units will straight up outrun you. And since you need to spend resources (ammo, stratagems, stims) to fight, if you can't outpace the spawns, you just end up in a death spiral where you're indefinitely on the run and can't recover to get anything done. On top of that, squids arguably have the highest resource demand of any faction with their big health pools and mass numbers of Voteless.

Squids are just this inescapable, unstoppable, lethal wall of meat where you either hit the DPS check or you lose. Positioning barely matters, target priority is irrelevant since everything is equally deadly, CC is mostly nullified by Fleshmobs. I don't find it very engaging.",4,1753290078.0

At the *very least*, this is something that should be done moving forward *because* they have had problems with weapon animations and scopes specifically in the past, a 30 minute check every update before pushing to live is a reasonable QA test to set as SOP after previous bugs.

I saw that name on media some weeks ago, I dont care about leaks or anything but I took a look and found that on Crimsca they going to name a city like the leak suggests. 

And I dont belive it, I belive is a easter egg or a placeholder. 

And also by this time Crimsca remains under Super Earth control and is not under attack so we cant confirm nothing but Helldivers Companion added it no problem, but with unrevealed cities stays as ""city or settlement""

So... The majority of the playerbase have no idea until Crimsca is under attack, and I woulnt be surprised not finding that name on it, what a nightmare must been to fit it on the UI.

Based on statistics though - it really more likely to be a decent player on level 150, especially on the hardest difficulty, than to be as good if you're around level 30.

Some level 150 players are more equal than the others.

You get at this level in about 300-ish hour mark.

I personally have been level 150 for more than 1k hours.

It's expected for me to be better than the average fresh level 150 - and I would accept and take any judgement for that not being so.

So you are both right and objectively wrong.

Levels do mean something in the common case, but not enough.

Me having near million kills across the all factions surely have to mean I know to fight each and every enemy better than someone that have killed a 5th of that amount.

1m7b2ff,n4qtndz,_M_I_A_W_S_,t3_1m7b2ff,"I both agree and disagree with this. A small part in this is players below level 90 still have upgrades to unlock. They may not be super important upgrades but it does make many of them run around looking for samples. Players over that level have usually been more free to experiment—play with new weapons, loadouts, tactics, armors, etc.

You have to also remember that more often than not, level 150 players have been level 150 for a LONG time. They likely have triple the playtime a player level 90 has. That doesn’t always mean they are good, but again, more often than not, they’re better than you… of course, everyone has their bad days.

Now the most important thing to consider: Great players can get screwed by bad teammates. A few examples:

Recall that when new players join the game, they tend to stand in the worst places and get team killed a lot. Usually they fly off the handle and say “Stop killing me!” They don’t understand they are standing in front of everyone’s fire.  It’s not the veterans, it’s the cadet.

The same thing happens with all-level players playing new factions. I played bugs solely until I was level 70. When I went to bots, I got wrecked. I didn’t know where to stand, so bots kept killing me. I still knew how to avoid getting TK’d but I had no idea about the tactics required.

Recently, I had a squad on a D10 triple flag mission. The level 70’s didn’t understand that the flag raises quicker when the whole team is nearby, so it was me and the 150 by ourselves dying countless times to the jet brigade. No mics. We just watched them run around the radar. We got it done but we died over five times each easily.

If you see level 150’s dying a lot, watch them. See why. It may not be because they suck (but it definitely could be).

In certain missions, dying and even team killing doesn’t really matter. This sometimes angers players under level 90. For example when I bring 380, 120, napalm barrage and laser to eradicate, many will tell me not to, but 150’s don’t care because they usually know deaths don’t matter because eradicates are easy. (I bring extra reinforcements anyway)

Sometimes 150’s team kill each other because they are bored, or fed up with someone. 

Sometimes they’re using up the reinforcement budget for fun.

Sometimes they bring the flag and the saber because it’s a fun challenge. 

Sometimes they hand the sticks to their little brother. 

Sometimes they’re AFK.

It’s always a mixed bag, but more often than not, if I’m looking to clear missions, I’m joining the 150 squad.  — trash lvl 140.",1,1753290254.0

I die all the damn time on Diff 10 but it's because I play an aggressive assault play style. I'm sick of this community acting like arbitrary stats equate to skill.

A couple weeks ago I decided to get my own console and copy of the game (I had to take the decision of creating a whole new account, losing all progress, gun levels, ship upgrades) Now that I’m leveling up again I find myself (a level 22) playing with players levels 100+ on superhelldive and sometimes I’m more effective (with limited gear) than the others with all warbonds and gear. I understand that the knowledge and understanding of the enemy behavior is directly related to playing time (so does the xp gained to level up) but not all divers are able to fully understand everything and that is okay in my books, but it confirms that not because you are lvl 150 you are John Helldiver. It’s always cool having the support of higher level players as they may have more gear and are able to help you eradicating those undemocratic bastards, but they have to understand that some players look up on them and have high expectations from them.

You die a lot in this game. Sometimes it’s skill issue. Another time it’s your teammate throwing a napalm barrage right next to you without warning. Sometimes you just wanna dive into a crowd of bugs with your hellbomb pack.

As far as lossless scaling I think it takes up too much performance to be useful. For instance, I may be getting 95-120 with a 4090/78003d but with lossless scaling it will lower the base frame rate to about 75-85 before then multiplying it up to 160 or 240 or 360 depending on what I set it at. To me 100-120 fps native feels too much better than 80 from a responsiveness stand point to make that trade.

As a chaff clear, I would have to disagree, the AOE at max charge is kinda small. Visually it looks big for some reason. The other CC(Crowd control) weapons do a much better job.

Pretty much its a mid weapon even when you get the timing down. Pretty much its better if they leaned on either AT or CC.

I think a good change would be if you dont charge it up all the way it has a huge AOE but lower damage. If you charge it up all the way it has a smaller AOE but it has nutty damage. Basically the weapon has time to focus the plasma or something.

The aoe in particular is a very underrated target for buffs, it’s nice against packed groups but has a deceivingly small area. That should be what gives it a reason to exist as a more difficult to use AT weapon imo. Otherwise, besides fun factor, what’s the reward for the high skill floor? Right now it certainly isn’t ammo economy or sheer damage

EDIT: no backpack is pretty nice so maybe just the four per mag would be good as far as ammo? In either case I think it’s far, far from *awful* right now it’s just all these other options have much more clearly defined use cases and the Hulk-popper type role it most cleanly fits into is just done flatly better by the railgun imo.

 It will kill Hulks in two maxed unsafe body shots and one maxed unsafe shot to the eye or vents. You're basically shooting fridges as well so once the spread is fixed it will be amazing.

Minus the Demo force, if you rolled the Commando and Quasar into one gun it would be this gun. I can get not liking that it explodes but the Railgun has been explosive for a long time now and it's never gotten backlash as far as I've seen.

 If it's that big an issue I would say they should just add a switch like on the Railgun so you can toggle safe and unsafe.

Beats RR's ammo efficiency (15 shots with a heavy kill every 1 or 2 shots) whilst not taking a backpack slot.

Has more AOE than either of the other options, so can flex into anti-medium and to a lesser degree anti-horde.

1m6quro,n4ok0yr,Jodelbert,t3_1m6quro,"Honestly, i really like the idea of the Epoch.

The quasar does the latter on a cooldown and a 3-sec wind up. It's very versatile and has limitless ammo, but you need to be better prepared to use it properly.

The EATs are just ""oh shit"" buttons to quickly get solutions, but their one time use and having to constantly calling them back makes them not ideal for every situation.

SPEARs are just... ok i guess, if you stand far away but...

...if you are good with the RR you don't even need a guided missile when hitting weak spots with it. The stationary reload makes you vulnerable and a slow shooter. Ultimately the RR outperforms the Epoch because it also comes with chaff-clearing-services, when you change the warhead to ""explosive"" rather than anti-tank.

Epoch has a lower range than RR, almost no chaff-clearing abilities unless you REALLY go up in charge and the damage it does against heavy enemies is good, but the risks to constantly get results are too high.

So my solution would be:

Honestly, why not make the whole gun have four linear values: Damage, Radius, Armor Pen and Projectile Speed.

At 0% Charge you lob a blob of plasma maybe as far as an Ultimatum and have a radius of something similar to a grenade launcher but with a bit more oomph, so you can use it as chaff clearing.

At 100% charge you will have a good chance to blow yourself up, but the projectile flies really fast, maybe a bit slower and with a bit more drag than a quasar shot. The damage will be comparable to a quasar, maybe even a bit more, has higher armor pen but does almost no splash damage.

So to sum it up:  
low charge = slow projectile, short range, medium damage and armor pen over a large explosion radius  
high charge = fast projectile, long range, heavy armor pen, almost no damage radius -> a true AT shot.

Low level charge, quick chaff clearing with moderate damage and pen and very limited ammo. High charge AT weapon and anything in between is a mix of the two.

So it's as versatile as the RR, but is more risky to use but more flexible.",1,1753262060.0

And now we have it: It's not only supposed to be an AT with some anti-infantry capacity, but it's supposed to outperform some designated, *more convenient* AT options. 

I'm assuming they mean the Quasar, EAT, and Commando, because it's convenient not to have to reload (Quasar) and convenient to have a (relatively) fast cool down emergency AT Strategem at the ready, that allows you to bring a machinegun or other anti-infantry support weapon without sacrificing longer ranged non-Orbital/Eagle AT capacity in your load-out.

The Epoch can take down larger enemies like the Fleshmobs because of its AoE catching every body part available and render it extremely weak within a single fully charged shot. Something that the majority of AT cannot compare as the AoE is far weaker. Though the Recoiless can be comparable but you'll be contesting over not only to smaller amount of rockets but also a backpack to support it, something Epoch does not need. That's where the Epoch shines, it fulfills a middle role of handling anything that's heavily armored but can be used to devastate anything with massive health as well so long the many body parts are caught within the 3m radius at full charge.

If you understand how explosive damage works, you'd know Epoch can really be a good support weapon. It may not be good against a largely spread out groups of enemies but if clustered, its definitely warranted.

The mags also make it better on ammo than the RR, but the RR isn't known for great ammo economy. Getting a whole mag from a random ammo tin instead of just the 1 RR round is a boon. Which would be an even better selling point with a 4 round mag (fingers crossed).

1m6quro,n4ou25o,9thJovianMoon,t1_n4n0o3a,"It's a case of choosing a design philosophy, there's (kind of) 3 when it comes to balancing.  
  
1. OverPowered launch, get people using the weapon/gear early, lots of numbers means lots of data and it means you can tune the gun down easier a few weeks or months later. Apex Legends often did this, it pisses off the playerbase *the most* but is theoretically the most efficent, it has some major drawbacks with power-creep though since it's more difficult to nerf in a way that still feels good for players and not leave moderately OP items as a result.   
  
2. Polished launch, spend absolubte fucktonnes of money hiring at least 300 QA testers to do at least 4-8hrs, gather the data and make a more accurate stab at balancing gamefeel with power, minor tweaks happen later when the main pool of data comes in, but changes are usually minor. This consistently costs the most by *a lot*. QA isn't cheap and AH aren't a big company. This is what most people expect but the work involved is more than I think most people realise, it requires significant extra dev time compared to pushing it a little janky and hot fixing it later.  
  
3. UnderPowered launch. This seems to be AH preferred philosophy and I get why, you release a gun kind of bad at first, watch the data and the complaints and buff accordingly, this also ends up with extremely balanced weapons eventually, and more importantly it slows power creep, because you're bringing things up to the expected baseline you're less likely to accidentally move the baseline up too. This also really pisses off a playerbase but more because they don't get the process involved in balancing something like helldivers where you want all the items to feel at least somewhat viable. 

(They did absolubtely fuck it this update, not going to say otherwise, but like have some sympathy.)

It sucks especially against ""light"" turrets, since then they can nail you with the follow-up shot

1m7dryx,n4r1qlx,SES-SpearofDemocracy,t3_1m7dryx,"My disagreement here is you are claiming people (like me) who think the Epoch is great (except for its obvious aim bug which has been acknowledge and will soon be addressed) are ok with being served ""literal shit on a plate"". I don't think its shit on a plate, and on paper AND in practice its up there with the RR in performance. The Devs hit the nail on the head... it takes \*Skill\* to use, and when mastered becomes a master of AT. Using it is not a Handicap, mastering it is an art. Before I provide the actual statistics on the weapon (on paper and in practice) let me share something I've come to realize as the AT meta has evolved:

  
With the introduction of more and more AT options, it is my opinion that the AT genre has been subdivided into 2 categories now. Medium Heavies (Hulks, Chargers, Impalers, Tanks) and Massive Heavies (Bile Titans, Factory Striders, Drop Ships). While every AT weapon can handle each of these categories, certain weapons start becoming more efficient in their sub categories, and the Epoch is the shining example of this that sparked this whole train of thought for me. I will share the Epochs capabilities in further detail below, but the TLDR is that with its ability to one shot all ""Medium Heavies"" It shines as a Medium AT with more ammo but the same kill per shot as the RR. Able to kill 3 Medium Heavies before reload and 15 total Medium Heavies before resupply. The RR on the other hand shines at Massive AT with the ability to one shot Bile Titans, Factory Striders, and Drop Ships. With 6 total shots and about 3 sec reload you can kill 6 of those Massive Heavies in about 15 seconds before needing a resupply. Now both can flex in each sub category, but with the plethora of Chargers on the field, the sheer power of the RR is wasted on such a common Heavy. On the flip side, the Epoch can 2 shot BTs and 3 shot Factory Striders, but the time and ammo investment is much steeper than the RR. Now for the Epochs Data, and why I think its not literal shit on a plate, but the king of Medium AT and a phenomenal weapon in its current state (except for the aim bug, of course).

  
1 Shots: Charger, Hulk, Tank, Turret, Impaler, AA Guns, Mortars, Gunships, Stingray, Harvester

2 Shots: BT, Fleshmob, War Strider

3 Shots: Factory Strider.

It holds 3 rounds with 4 backup (12) and does 800 damage and 800 explosive at AP5 max charge. For context RR (the king of AT) does 3200dmg and has 6 rounds. It does half the damage of RR with double the damage, having the same “effective” output as RR.

Here’s where it shines. Kill for kill against BTs, RR and Epoch kill the same amount (6). BUT, for all of those 1 shots I listed, you now DOUBLE the kills compared to the RR. Not to mention with 3 rounds, you have a higher ttk when multiple heavies are on the field as you can kill 3 before reloading where RR only gets one kill and needs to reload.

Finally it has no backpack allowing you to take Supply Pack OR Warp Pack (to dodge incoming fire while charging or to jump out of cover while charging).

Once the accuracy is fixed it’s going to be the king of Mid tier heavies with RR taking the title of massive heavy AT king (BTs and Factory Striders and Drop Ships). An efficient team would have an Epoch killing mid tier heavies while the RR saves ammo for massive heavies and Drop Ships.",9,1753292399.0

\- Obviously they need to fix the dispersion.  
\- Most of the time it takes 2 hits when doing AT work, yet there's 3 shots in the magazine. Make it 4 shots per mag & reduce the total number of mags by 1.  
\- Give it the same demo force as a frag grenade. I'm fine with it being low for lore reasons, but please let me close bugholes & co.  
\- Make the time between the weapon being fully charged and literal death just a little longer. Right now you must time your charge-up perfectly. This is perfectly doable from a ""don't let the weapon explode"" perspective, but it's annoying to have to sync your charge up and aiming perfectly; you cannot take a split second to adjust your aim.

Mind you, all of the above are not based on 'realism' or even on-paper balance compared to other weapons. Currently the Epoch isn't fun to use. I want them to make it fun to use.

Let me paint you a picture. You are John Helldiver, you hit every skill shot. You are hitting a Mega Nest and have a full Resupply on the ground for you. In the Mega Nest are 4 Bile Titans, 4 Impaler, and 4 Charger. Heres how you do with each AT Option:

RR: It one shots all of the enemies above. With a \~3 sec reload you get a kill and 3 sec reload 5 more times. Thats 15 seconds for 6 kill. Pick up the ammo (1 sec), 5 more reloads for another 15 seconds and 5 more kills. One final ammo pickup (1 sec), 1 more reload (3 sec) for your final kill.  38 seconds to kill 12 enemeis.

Spear: One shots all enemies. 4 Second reload, you get a kill with 3 more reloads (12 sec). 12 seconds for 4 kills. Pick up ammo (1 sec), 3 more reloads (12 sec) 3 more kills. Pick up ammo (1 sec), 3 more reloads (12 sec) 3 more kills. Pick up ammo (1 sec), 2 more reloads (8 sec) for your last 2 kills. 47 sec for all 12 kills

Epoch: It one shots Chargers and Impalers, 2 shots BTs. Charge time is about 3sec (so 9 sec for all 3 shots) and reload is also about 3 sec with cancelling like RR. First clip kills 3 chargers (9 sec). First reload for 3 sec. Second clip kills 3 impalers (9 sec). Second reload for 3 sec. Third clip kill 1 charger, 1 implaer, and injures a BT (9 sec). Third reload for 3 sec. Fourth clip finishes injured BT, kills second BT (9). Fourth reload for 3 sec. Last clip kills a BT and weakens the last BT (9 sec). Pick up ammo (1 sec). Reload 3 sec. Final shot 3 sec. 64 seconds to kill all 12 enemies.

Airburst: One shots chargers and impalers, can't kill BTs. 4 second reload. You get 1 kill, then 5 reloads (20 sec) for 5 more kills. Pick up ammo (1 sec). 3 more reloads (12 sec) 3 final kills. 4 BTs still alive. 33 seconds to kill 8 enemies.

EAT: Calling down the POD Kills a Charger, each rocket 1 shots an Impaler and a BT per Calldown. 2 second call down time, 60 Second Cooldown. First call in (2 sec) kills Charger, Rocket 1 kills BT (1 sec), Rocket 2 kill Impaler (1 sec). First Cooldown (60 sec). Second call in (2 sec) kill Charger, Rocket 1 kills BT (1 sec), Rocket 2 kill Impaler (1 sec). Second Cooldown (60 sec). Third call in (2 sec) kill Charger, Rocket 1 kills BT (1 sec), Rocket 2 kill Impaler (1 sec). Third Cooldown (60 sec). Fourth call in (2 sec) kill Charger, Rocket 1 kills BT (1 sec), Rocket 2 kill Impaler (1 sec). 196 seconds to kill all 12 enemies

Quasar: One shots all enemies. 3 seconds to charge per shot. 15 sec to cooldown between shots. After the first shot it is 18 seconds per kill. Thats 198 seconds for all 12 kills. In cold -33% (132 seconds for all 12 kills). In heat +33% (263 seconds for all 12 kills).

Commando: 2 shots all enemies. 3 second call down time. Pod kills Charger, each commando kills 2 Impalers or BTs. Cooldown time is 103 seconds. First call down (3 sec) kills charger, Rockets kill 2 BTs (2 sec). First Cooldown (103 sec). Second call down (3 sec) kills charger, Rockets kill 2 BTs (2 sec). Second Cooldown (103 sec). Third call down (3 sec) kills charger, Rockets kill 2 Impalers (2sec). Third Cooldown (103 sec).

Epoch does 800 damage (400 Durable Damage) and 800 Explosive Damage with an AP5 at Max Charge.

Behemoth Charger butt has 950 Hp is AP0 and is fatal. It takes 100% Durable damage and 0% ExDR (explosive Damage Reduction). That means 1 shot does 400 + 800 = 1200 damage and is a fatal shot

Impaler forehead has 1250 HP is AP0 and is fatal. It takes 75% Durable damage and 0% ExDR. That means 1 shot does (400 x 75%= 300) durable damage + (800 x 25%=200) Normal Damage + 800 Explosive damage for a total of 1300 damage and is a fatal shot

Bile Titan Head has 1500 HP is AP4 and is fatal. It takes 95% Durable damage and 50% ExDR. That means 1 shot does (400 x 95% = 380) durable damage + (800 x 5% = 40) normal damage + 400 Explosive damage for a total of 820 damage per shot. 820 x 2 = 1640 damage to the head in 2 shots and is fatal.

Hulk eye has 250 HP is AP4 and is fatal. It takes 25% Durable damage and is 100% ExDR. That means 1 shot does (400 x 25% = 100) durable damage + (800 x 75% = 600) normal damage for a total of 700 damage and is fatal.

Hulk vent has 900 HP is AP1 and is fatal. It takes 60% Durable damage and is 0% ExDR. That means 1 shot does (400 x 60% = 240) Durable damage + (800 x 40% = 320) normal damage + 800 explosive damage for a total of 1360 damage and is fatal.

War Strider leg has 1500 HP is AP4 and is fatal. It takes 80% Durable damage and is 50% ExDR. That means 1 shot does (400 x 80% = 320) Durable damage + (800 x 20% = 160) Normal damage and 400 Explosive damage for a total of 880 per shot. 880 x 2 = 1760 damage in 2 shots and is fatal

Tank Turret vent has 750 HP is AP3 and is fatal. It takes 100% Durable damage and is 0% ExDR. That means 1 shot does 400 durable damage + 800 Explosive damage for a total of 1200 damage and is fatal.

Tank Engine has 750 HP is AP3 and is fatal. It takes 100% Durable damage and is 50% ExDR. That means it takes 400 Durable damage + (800 x 50% = 400) explosive damage for a total of 800 damage and is fatal.

Factory Strider Belly has 1200 HP is AP3 and is fatal. It takes 100% Durable damage and is 40% Ex DR. That means 1 shot does 400 durable damage + (800 x 40% = 320) explosive damage for a total of 720. 720 x 2 = 1440 damage and is fatal. \*NOTE\* I have had to take 3 shots for a Factory Strider, I am not sure why there is a discrepancy here, the wiki could be wrong and it could be 2100 instead of 1200, which makes the 3 shots make sense, OR Devastators were dropped at the time absorbing one of the shots.

All AP4 weapons can kill all enemies, usually with extensive ammo. Yes the Railgun can perform quite well on the bot front, although you won't be killing War Striders or Factory Striders with it (or not as quickly anyway). On the Bug front, the Railgun is not stacking up as well.
